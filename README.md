A menu bar app that displays live air quality informations from the nearest [Airly](https://airly.eu/en/) sensor station. It also notifies you when the air quality changes or when a new station that is closer to your current location was found.

**Note:** This app is still in the work-in-progress-full-of-bugs state. No "stable" release with auto-updater, no docs, guides, etc. Moreover, [Airly](https://airly.eu/en/) sensor stations are probably only available in Poland (but I have plans to support different APIs and data providers).
