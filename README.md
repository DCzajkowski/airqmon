A menu bar app that displays live air quality informations from the nearest [Airly][airly] sensor station. It also notifies you when the air quality changes or when a new station that is closer to your current location was found.

**Note:** This app is still in the work-in-progress-full-of-bugs state. No "stable" release, no docs, guides, etc. Moreover, [Airly][airly] sensor stations are probably only located in Poland (but I have plans to later add support for different APIs and data providers).
